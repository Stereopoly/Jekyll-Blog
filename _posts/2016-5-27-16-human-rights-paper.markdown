## Introduction

“Our cellphones were confiscated and placed in plastic bags for us to collect on our way back home. We were allowed to keep our laptops and cameras, but nothing with GPS or satellite-tracking devices.” That is the current situation in North Korea. The government watches over everything you do, everything you say, and everywhere you go. Any technology from other countries is confiscated and cannot be used within North Korea. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19, states that everyone has the “Freedom of Opinion and Information”. Nearly all countries satisfy this right, but not North Korea.


Over the last 30 years, North Korea has built up a closely monitored intranet, called Kwangmyong, by the Korea Computer Center, to ensure only pro-North Korea information can be accessed. Even so, only certain elite schools, universities, research institutions, and privileged individuals can use the intranet. The government doesn't want the middle and lower class citizens of the country to learn about the outside world and find out negative things about the North Korean government.  According to Reporters Without Borders, North Korea is rated 179 out of 180 countries on the press freedom index. This index is an annual ranking of countries, based upon the freedom of the press and journalism. Due to such internet censorship, the middle class people of North Korea cannot get uncensored information about their country. They can only access propaganda that their leader, Kim Jong Un, wants them to know. This control leads to the North Korean government having complete dictatorship over their people. In turn, the government can stay in power and keep its people in the dark.


There have been several organizations trying to help the people in North Korea. The Eugene Bell Foundation travels to North Korea twice a year, bringing medical equipment and drugs to treat patients at the old North Korean hospitals. The population has been weakened by malnutrition since the 1990s, and therefore there are higher risks of disease. The foundation recently went on a three-week mission to North Korea to help hundreds of patients. Several organizations work with undercover citizens in South Korea to transport accurate news and food to North Korea. A company in the Silicon Valley is also helping North Korea. They have built a low-cost computer with Wikipedia, and other information pre-downloaded to them. The North Korean government, on the other hand, has been constantly trying to stop these organizations by tightening border control.


## Historical Background

North Korea is located in Eastern Asia, neighboring China, Russia, and South Korea. The Korean peninsula has been invaded several times. The UN has tried to create peace and form a government there, but in 1948, the North and South Korea decided to become two independent countries. After the separation, North Korea created the Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. This constitution is similar to that of the United States. It states that “Citizens are guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, demonstration and association. The State shall guarantee conditions for the free activity of democratic political parties and social organizations.” Even with such a promising constitution, it was all an illusion created by the government. In North Korea, there is only one party, the Korean Worker’s Party, which holds all the power. They demand loyalty to the government, and can do anything they want to achieve it, no matter what the constitution states. 


Since the establishment of North Korea, freedom of opinion and information has been restricted more and more harshly, up until the new millennium. When North Korea was founded on September 9, 1948, there was no internet and easy ways to spread information, other than by paper. They adopted communism as their national ideology. As technology advanced, an intranet in North Korea was developed called Kwangmyong. A 3G cellular network was even developed, but only accessible by foreigners. All computers in North Korea also run an operating system the government developed called Red Star OS. It is a version of Linux, that has been designed to look like Macintosh operating systems, but limited to a small subset of functionality. Some people have gained access to a copy of Red Star OS and describe it as follows. “Red Star has audio and video players, and even a game — Korean chess. There’s a Firefox-style search engine called “Our Country,” which helps users navigate around an estimated 1,000 to 5,500 websites, mostly for universities, government offices, libraries and state-run corporations.”


## Modern Day Responses

In most countries in the world, the freedom of opinion and information is contained within their constitution. For example, the United States Constitution states this basic right in the Bill of Rights. North Korea has a similar constitution, but the government has decided to not abide by it. The government demands absolute obedience, and can do whatever they want to get it. This has led to the unwarranted detention of citizens from other countries visiting North Korea. An American student, Otto Warmbier, was arrested in North Korea after going through customs. The North Korean government described that Warmbier entered the government “for the purpose of bringing down the foundation of its single-minded unity at the tacit connivance of the U.S. government.” In addition, a 62 year old man, named Kim Dong Chul, was detained by the North Korean government, after meeting another North Korean person. Sadly, the U.S. government cannot help these people directly, because they do not have an embassy. We have to communicate to North Korea via the Swedish embassy, which makes things a lot harder. The North Korean government and the United States government are not on good terms.


A lot of help that has been given to the citizens of North Korea but has gotten harder this has gotten harder to provide as North Korea has been tightening their border control. An organization in Seoul, South Korea, Free North Korea Radio, has been broadcasting uncensored news from South Korea into North Korea. The founder of the radio station, Kim Seong Min, believes that North Koreans are secretly tuning into the radio. It is illegal in North Korea to modify the radios to tune into non-propaganda stations, but an increasing number of them are. There have been multiple news articles written about the radio stations, and the scripts are also available online. The few people who transport news from inside North Korea to the outside have praised foreign radio stations. Also, a company in the Silicon Valley has developed a small computer running Ubuntu Linux, which has Wikipedia, New World Encyclopedia, and a variety of other news articles downloaded onto the computer for offline browsing. These computers are about the size of a small laptop, so they can be easily transported. People in Seoul, South Korea have begun to smuggle them across the border to North Koreans. These computers have previously been shipped to remote regions in Africa and South America, where there is no internet access, and they have been very popular.


All of the help that has been brought to North Korea has been welcomed by the citizens, but not by the government. The government runs on a philosophy of “Juche”, or self-reliance. This means that they do not welcome help from other countries, which, to them, makes them feel more powerful. They are not grateful to other countries and organizations helping them. Seoul has been one of the most prominent supporters of North Korea, sending them 2.1 billion dollars worth of food and fertilizer. In return, North Korea has been attacking South Korea, leading to South Korea stopping their help.


## Conclusion

North Korea’s human rights can be improved drastically without completely transforming the regime. Currently, North Korea has complete control over its citizens’ freedom of opinion and information. There are several ways that North Korea can improve this human right.


The first is accepting other country’s help. The current situation is that North Korea has been trying very hard to control their borders and not letting any foreigners in with the intention of helping its citizens. The government expresses itself as an independent nation capable of sustaining itself. Clearly, from newspapers and statistics, the country has suffered famines and disease outbreaks killing millions of people in the past. By allowing foreign governments to send food, shelter, and other basic necessities, North Korea can catch up with the rest of civilization and develop their nation.


The second is opening up. North Korea is currently completely closed off to the rest of the world. Some daring tourists have traveled to North Korea and wrote about how far behind the country is. Their subways are the trains that the Soviet Union used to have. The App Store where you get apps for your smartphone is a physical store. These were just a couple examples showing how far behind North Korea is compared to the rest of the world. By opening their country, people from foreign countries can bring their technology to North Korea and help them develop. More embassies can be opened and tensions between North Korea and other countries can be reduced. The country can develop and the people of North Korea can live better lives.


The third is reducing censorship. Currently, North Korea completely censors the news and internet. There is only one newspaper called The Pyongyang Times, which is controlled and written by the government. North Korea has their own intranet which only high ranking officers and professors can use. There are very few websites that are accessible, all of which only contain pro-North Korea information. By reducing censorship and letting the North Koreans to access more of the internet, and read about their own country, it puts pressure on the government to improve the country. In addition, the citizens will be grateful of the government for finally allowing them access to uncensored information. The people of the country can learn from other countries and quickly advance their technology and lifestyle.


Changing North Korea’s view towards freedom of information and opinion will be tough, but these changes would bring the country prosperity and happiness.
