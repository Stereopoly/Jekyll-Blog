        <title>HRP TED Talk</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;human-rights-project-ted-talk&quot;&gt;Human Rights Project Ted Talk&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing the human rights research paper, we recorded a TED talk about the same topic, using the information we gathered as a basis for the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/a/mvla.net/file/d/0B44C5rRwFzzvQ3ppV2d4Q0p5NWs/view?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reflection&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TED talk was a very interesting assignment because it allowed use to take our quite long research paper and condense it into a nice format. I used a slide deck made in Keynote to accompany the voice recording. I felt like I improved with designing an engaging and informative presentation during this assignment. At first, I was planning to use Google Slides, but the slides were too drab and boring to look at. I looked at previous slides uses at Apple keynotes, because those are usually very good. I used a lot of images and almost no text on my slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that this project was very interesting because it allowed us to learn about a current world problem and then create a product, not just a research paper. Most other classes we would just write a paper and that was the end of the project. One thing that I disliked about the project was that I didn’t have enough time to try to make animations and other nice touches like real TED talks had. I enjoyed making the slides because I learned a lot about making them nice and appealing. I used Final Cut Pro X at the end of the recording to cut out the annoying Screencastify watermark that was at the top right corner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Human Rights Research Paper</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our cellphones were confiscated and placed in plastic bags for us to collect on our way back home. We were allowed to keep our laptops and cameras, but nothing with GPS or satellite-tracking devices.” That is the current situation in North Korea. The government watches over everything you do, everything you say, and everywhere you go. Any technology from other countries is confiscated and cannot be used within North Korea. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19, states that everyone has the “Freedom of Opinion and Information”. Nearly all countries satisfy this right, but not North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, North Korea has built up a closely monitored intranet, called Kwangmyong, by the Korea Computer Center, to ensure only pro-North Korea information can be accessed. Even so, only certain elite schools, universities, research institutions, and privileged individuals can use the intranet. The government doesn’t want the middle and lower class citizens of the country to learn about the outside world and find out negative things about the North Korean government.  According to Reporters Without Borders, North Korea is rated 179 out of 180 countries on the press freedom index. This index is an annual ranking of countries, based upon the freedom of the press and journalism. Due to such internet censorship, the middle class people of North Korea cannot get uncensored information about their country. They can only access propaganda that their leader, Kim Jong Un, wants them to know. This control leads to the North Korean government having complete dictatorship over their people. In turn, the government can stay in power and keep its people in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been several organizations trying to help the people in North Korea. The Eugene Bell Foundation travels to North Korea twice a year, bringing medical equipment and drugs to treat patients at the old North Korean hospitals. The population has been weakened by malnutrition since the 1990s, and therefore there are higher risks of disease. The foundation recently went on a three-week mission to North Korea to help hundreds of patients. Several organizations work with undercover citizens in South Korea to transport accurate news and food to North Korea. A company in the Silicon Valley is also helping North Korea. They have built a low-cost computer with Wikipedia, and other information pre-downloaded to them. The North Korean government, on the other hand, has been constantly trying to stop these organizations by tightening border control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;historical-background&quot;&gt;Historical Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is located in Eastern Asia, neighboring China, Russia, and South Korea. The Korean peninsula has been invaded several times. The UN has tried to create peace and form a government there, but in 1948, the North and South Korea decided to become two independent countries. After the separation, North Korea created the Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. This constitution is similar to that of the United States. It states that “Citizens are guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, demonstration and association. The State shall guarantee conditions for the free activity of democratic political parties and social organizations.” Even with such a promising constitution, it was all an illusion created by the government. In North Korea, there is only one party, the Korean Worker’s Party, which holds all the power. They demand loyalty to the government, and can do anything they want to achieve it, no matter what the constitution states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the establishment of North Korea, freedom of opinion and information has been restricted more and more harshly, up until the new millennium. When North Korea was founded on September 9, 1948, there was no internet and easy ways to spread information, other than by paper. They adopted communism as their national ideology. As technology advanced, an intranet in North Korea was developed called Kwangmyong. A 3G cellular network was even developed, but only accessible by foreigners. All computers in North Korea also run an operating system the government developed called Red Star OS. It is a version of Linux, that has been designed to look like Macintosh operating systems, but limited to a small subset of functionality. Some people have gained access to a copy of Red Star OS and describe it as follows. “Red Star has audio and video players, and even a game — Korean chess. There’s a Firefox-style search engine called “Our Country,” which helps users navigate around an estimated 1,000 to 5,500 websites, mostly for universities, government offices, libraries and state-run corporations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modern-day-responses&quot;&gt;Modern Day Responses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most countries in the world, the freedom of opinion and information is contained within their constitution. For example, the United States Constitution states this basic right in the Bill of Rights. North Korea has a similar constitution, but the government has decided to not abide by it. The government demands absolute obedience, and can do whatever they want to get it. This has led to the unwarranted detention of citizens from other countries visiting North Korea. An American student, Otto Warmbier, was arrested in North Korea after going through customs. The North Korean government described that Warmbier entered the government “for the purpose of bringing down the foundation of its single-minded unity at the tacit connivance of the U.S. government.” In addition, a 62 year old man, named Kim Dong Chul, was detained by the North Korean government, after meeting another North Korean person. Sadly, the U.S. government cannot help these people directly, because they do not have an embassy. We have to communicate to North Korea via the Swedish embassy, which makes things a lot harder. The North Korean government and the United States government are not on good terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of help that has been given to the citizens of North Korea but has gotten harder this has gotten harder to provide as North Korea has been tightening their border control. An organization in Seoul, South Korea, Free North Korea Radio, has been broadcasting uncensored news from South Korea into North Korea. The founder of the radio station, Kim Seong Min, believes that North Koreans are secretly tuning into the radio. It is illegal in North Korea to modify the radios to tune into non-propaganda stations, but an increasing number of them are. There have been multiple news articles written about the radio stations, and the scripts are also available online. The few people who transport news from inside North Korea to the outside have praised foreign radio stations. Also, a company in the Silicon Valley has developed a small computer running Ubuntu Linux, which has Wikipedia, New World Encyclopedia, and a variety of other news articles downloaded onto the computer for offline browsing. These computers are about the size of a small laptop, so they can be easily transported. People in Seoul, South Korea have begun to smuggle them across the border to North Koreans. These computers have previously been shipped to remote regions in Africa and South America, where there is no internet access, and they have been very popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the help that has been brought to North Korea has been welcomed by the citizens, but not by the government. The government runs on a philosophy of “Juche”, or self-reliance. This means that they do not welcome help from other countries, which, to them, makes them feel more powerful. They are not grateful to other countries and organizations helping them. Seoul has been one of the most prominent supporters of North Korea, sending them 2.1 billion dollars worth of food and fertilizer. In return, North Korea has been attacking South Korea, leading to South Korea stopping their help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s human rights can be improved drastically without completely transforming the regime. Currently, North Korea has complete control over its citizens’ freedom of opinion and information. There are several ways that North Korea can improve this human right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is accepting other country’s help. The current situation is that North Korea has been trying very hard to control their borders and not letting any foreigners in with the intention of helping its citizens. The government expresses itself as an independent nation capable of sustaining itself. Clearly, from newspapers and statistics, the country has suffered famines and disease outbreaks killing millions of people in the past. By allowing foreign governments to send food, shelter, and other basic necessities, North Korea can catch up with the rest of civilization and develop their nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is opening up. North Korea is currently completely closed off to the rest of the world. Some daring tourists have traveled to North Korea and wrote about how far behind the country is. Their subways are the trains that the Soviet Union used to have. The App Store where you get apps for your smartphone is a physical store. These were just a couple examples showing how far behind North Korea is compared to the rest of the world. By opening their country, people from foreign countries can bring their technology to North Korea and help them develop. More embassies can be opened and tensions between North Korea and other countries can be reduced. The country can develop and the people of North Korea can live better lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is reducing censorship. Currently, North Korea completely censors the news and internet. There is only one newspaper called The Pyongyang Times, which is controlled and written by the government. North Korea has their own intranet which only high ranking officers and professors can use. There are very few websites that are accessible, all of which only contain pro-North Korea information. By reducing censorship and letting the North Koreans to access more of the internet, and read about their own country, it puts pressure on the government to improve the country. In addition, the citizens will be grateful of the government for finally allowing them access to uncensored information. The people of the country can learn from other countries and quickly advance their technology and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing North Korea’s view towards freedom of information and opinion will be tough, but these changes would bring the country prosperity and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-trans-pacific-slave-trade&quot;&gt;The Trans-Pacific Slave Trade&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;article-link---15-minute-historyhttp15minutehistoryorg20160113episode-76-the-trans-pacific-slave-trade&quot;&gt;Article Link - &lt;a href=&quot;http://15minutehistory.org/2016/01/13/episode-76-the-trans-pacific-slave-trade/&quot;&gt;15 Minute History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the Trans-Pacific Slave trade?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the Manila Galleon?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is Diego De la Cruz?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where is Manila?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connections&quot;&gt;Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trans-Pacific slave trade relates to WWI in which there was a lot of fighting and wars between the Spanish and hte natives. They converted all the people to Christianity and this was tough at times. The slave trade led to improved technologies, like slave galleon ships, just like WWI led to a lot of new modern technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-knowledge&quot;&gt;New Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Manila Galleon is an annual flotilla between Manila and Acapulco.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The article describes the life of Diego de la Cruz, a slave who managed to escape slavery in Central America.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Spanish chose Manila as a new capital because it was near China and was very easy for them to join the trading network. Manila was also a good location to start converting all of Asia to Christianity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where is North Korea?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is the right being violated?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is North Korea’s leader?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does North Korea do about the right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connections&quot;&gt;Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our class, we learned about WWI and how there was a lot of propaganda being created about fighting in the war. People created a lot of posters and advertisement recruiting men to fight the glorious war. North Korea does similar style of propaganda, telling the people in their country how amazing they are and how the rest of the world is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;information&quot;&gt;Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Press Freedom index rates North Korea 97/100, with 100 being the worst.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Press Status is officially noted as ‘Not Free’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;North Korea’s freedom of information and opinion gained attention after the regime threatened war on the United States over a comedy called the Interview, depicting an attempt to assassinate Kim Jong Un.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;North Korea’s citizens secretly tune into foreign radios and TV stations, to get uncensored information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Legacy of Imperialism</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-legacy-of-imperialism&quot;&gt;The Legacy of Imperialism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;article-link---reutershttpwwwreuterscomarticleus-india-independence-legacy-idussp29531720070815&quot;&gt;Article Link - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-independence-legacy-idUSSP29531720070815&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many people in India speak English?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did the Bangalore-based firm announce?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the Indian Administrative Service?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cricket, the sport, has done what for India?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connections&quot;&gt;Connections:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source relates to the Imperialism effects we have been learning about in India. We had a debate about whether or not Imperialism helped or hurt India more. This article writes about the longer lasting effects of British Imperialism on India. It shows a new perspective, because Reuters is a British news company, which may be biased towards the British people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-knowledge&quot;&gt;New Knowledge:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English is the number one language in India, and may not have been if the British hadn’t come to imperialize. Several firms within India have reached out to other countries, creating software to help them learn English too. The British gave India the notion of law, a parliamentary democracy, and constitutional government, an organized civil service, police force, military, and the legal system. All the key institutions were brought about to India by the British. Laws created by the British when they imperialize India haven’t changed much since. The most damaging legacy, is that the government setup by the British was not to run a 1 billion people country, but a relatively small colony.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;north-korea-brutality&quot;&gt;North Korea Brutality&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;article-link---cnnhttpwwwcnncom20151210asiaun-north-korea-meeting&quot;&gt;Article Link - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/10/asia/un-north-korea-meeting/&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CNN article describes North Korea and how criminals, rebels, and foreign nationals are tortured in horrible conditions. 8 torture methods are described, including solitary confinement in a 1 meter by 1.2 meter box, holding a set position until exhaustion, and beatings until vomiting blood. The article calls out North Korea for their human rights violations and wants them to face international criminal court. Up to now, only a warning has been given by the UN and no action has been taken in court due to China and Russia resisting such action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-rights-impact&quot;&gt;Human Rights Impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human rights violations described impact practically all of the 30 human rights we have. The torture methods wear you down to the bare bones and you are always on the brink of death. No where near adequate food is provided. The humans rights are virtually nonexistent in these torture chambers. The prisoners have no say or due process in court. Most countries look down upon North Korea’s leadership due to them ignoring human rights of their prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-actions-to-improve-human-rights&quot;&gt;Future Actions to Improve Human Rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments have already called North Korea out on their horrible human rights laws and how they treat their people. Their ruler hasn’t responded at all and hasn’t tried to improve the conditions of the people of North Korea. We need to take Kim Jong Un to international court about these human rights violations. Meanwhile, we can help the people of North Korea by supporting humanitarian organizations working in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fall Semester Reflection</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backward-looking&quot;&gt;Backward Looking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I have done several movies for a variety of subjects like science and history. In 7th grade, I did a movie about our solar system and how it affects humans and animals on Earth. Comparing it to the rap battle I made this fall, it was not as good. The rap battle had both a movie and a homemade music track, while the science video only had video. I have gotten a lot better at using music mixing software since 7th grade to be able to make this rap battle sound pretty good. In 8th grade history, I made a video using flashcards and I would quickly flash them in front of the screen to make a flipbook style video. It was not very good since everything was very shaky, and the voice recording was very bad. The rap battle that my group and I made had very good sound quality because we recorded with good microphones. The music was also mixed with better software and I have gotten better at it since 8th grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;forward-looking&quot;&gt;Forward Looking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rap battle that I made with my group could be improved in several ways. I think the music of the video should’ve been done as a parody of one song instead of having each of us rap it out. Using a parody would make the music flow better and we could use autotune to make our voices sound amazing. Also, I think our video could be improved. Instead of having large blocks of text on the screen for the reader to view, we could somehow display the text as the music advanced to make it more natural and easier to get the information. As well as improving the video, I think our group could add subtitles to the video so that the listener can hear our voices better since we aren’t that great singers. Finally, the communication outside of school about the project wasn’t very good, so I think we could’ve gotten more done if we had decided to get each other’s numbers. This would have allowed us to set up meetings outside of class time to work on the project and make it even better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>illuminati</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-illuminati&quot;&gt;The illuminati&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati&quot;&gt;Illuminati&lt;/a&gt;: This source has data, pictures, and written descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.illuminatirex.com/illuminati-symbol-great-seal-one-dollar-bill/&quot;&gt;Illuminati Conspiracy Theories&lt;/a&gt;: This source has pictures and written descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How did the illuminati form?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What caused the illuminati to be formed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who founded the illuminati?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What did the illuminati do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;connections&quot;&gt;Connections:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our class, we have been learning about religion and how the Renaissance has affected it. The illuminati is a secret group that was created by and for people who thought against the Church. This relates to what we have been learning because the people in the Renaissance are starting to turn away from the Church and think on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-knowledge&quot;&gt;New Knowledge:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The illuminati was formed by a man named Adam Weishaupt. It was formed to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence in life, and the abuse of state power. They, and other secret societies were outlawed, but still continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The illuminati now refers to organizations who claim to be secret societies and are pushing for the same goal. They have been alleged to have tried to gain political power and influence by planting secret agents. These lead to some conspiracy theories about the illuminati in the shadows of various TV shows and the dollar bill.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are various conspiracy theories about the dollar bill. For example, the pyramid on the dollar bill is very similar to the Bavarian Illuminati pyramid. If you circle various letters on the text around the pyramid, you get the word Mason. There are 13 steps on the pyramid, 13 stars on the seal, 13 letters in E Pluribus Unum, 13 arrows on the seal, 13 leaves on the seal, and 13 berries on the seal. These all relate to the 13 bloodlines of the illuminati.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
